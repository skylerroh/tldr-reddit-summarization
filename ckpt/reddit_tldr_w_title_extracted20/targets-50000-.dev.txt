I find a more inward, self-directed approach to dealing with negative emotions to be both more efficient and less burdensome (to others and yourself) than seeking the support of others.

Superhero movies are mostly defined on who makes the movie, less about the actual story of the movie.

Dr. Shim modified an Exo with his tech. Also, the Exo-Stranger has eyebrows that strongly resemble an ancient Chinese custom.

it's ok to be a tanky top laner sometimes. Also if you get good at Cho you can easily get kills playing the lane right. You don't always need to be an assassin to make an impact/difference in the game. So stop taking viability quite so seriously, almost all champs are viable if played right or put into a proper environment. Just pick who you're good at and like if they suit the situation.

A strange, former fellow college student can't seem to leave me alone even though I haven't talked to him since 2010. He manipulates and says inappropriate things, but has never been seen doing anything illegal. 
 EDIT: Just to clarify because several of you have been bringing it up. I have not actually messaged or spoken to this guy since mid/late 2011. I explicitly told him to leave me alone, but every few months he pops up again and I just ignore it. It has taken this long to identify all the mediums in which he has to contact me.

With the vtc4, in a hybrid mech, can I safely stay at .18ohms all day from 4.2 down to 3.7 volts? 
 Almost sure the answer is yes, ohms law says I'm at 30 amps at .14 ohms. 
 The devil on my shoulder is telling me I would be fine even around .1 ohm, because there's no way I'm ever getting a full 4.2 volts and because the pulse rating is probably higher than 30 amps. 
 The angel on the other side is saying to leave a safety cushion and stay around .23ohms

The current ban system can deny players champions for long periods of time. As a result, you can literally ban out certain champions that players are known for and force them to not practice those champions any longer. 
 My suggestion: After each team bans their first champion, they're allowed to pick their first champion. 
Eg. Team 1 bans Kassadin. 
Team 2 bans Fizz.
Team 1 picks Gragas.
Team 2 picks Ahri.
Team 1 bans Zed.
etc.
This way, if you really don't want to deal with Kassadin, you can still first ban him

A guy I've spoken to mostly at parties/while hanging out with mutual friends asked me to go the same performance of a play he's going to because he "doesn't like sitting alone". Mutual Friend #1 told me this is probably some kind of date, or a precursor to dates, but I'm confused because the details seem vague and neither one of us has the other's phone number. I'm a total dating-as-a-20-something virgin because I just got out a relationship I'd been in since high school. Any advice/knowledge about any of this?

Basically, as a carry, gold and items win games. You want to keep it at about 100 CS/10 mins for good farm. Most importantly, understand the difference between late and mid game carries and also that when you get better, you can play them in opposite roles. You have to keep your composure and farm, determine when to split push and when to avoid team fights.

In the film, it's only implied that Hellstrom figures out that the Basterds are imposters because of the "3-finger order," but that was only theorized by Bridget von Hammersmark. In actuality, Hellstrom knew IMMEDIATELY. Instead of blowing their covers, he toys with them, especially Stiglitz, knowing he's got the tactical advantage, and he even gets them tipsy beforehand.

Will I miss out on college experiences if I don't always do things that everyone does? I don't really seek out sex, as a guy with a normal sex drive, I can find sex and and whatnot as a distraction.

The film light-heartedly portrayed a female character being kidnapped by a large burly man who claims her as his own as he pulls her back in time to ancient Greece.
