pub+dev's want to push a game out on all the popular platforms. Each platform needs to be tweaked to allow the target performance.

Not many are willing to take that risk seeing as the WiiU doesn't exactly have a modest install base yet.

Zirene playing devil's advocate in the match today was actually a really nice break from all the typical agreement we tend to see. I enjoyed his side of the argument, and this is clearly seen not only here, but very much regularly on ESPN, where analysts debate to prove which team or which player is the mroe impressive by introducing statistics and their own ideas to the plate. This is seen in basketball, soccer, football, and I believe that arguments such as these help pave the way for the growth of E-sports and its accpetance as a more legitamte model for entertainment among critiques.

There needs to be a plot or overarching objective that is personal and everything you do must be tied with it. Another way to make questing a bit more interesting is (and this will sound odd) but ditch all the side objectives and the kill 10 boars quests. Lay out the primary objective and let people decide how they want to approach the overall mission. Also, don't handhold by listing the specific details of the different ways to complete a quest let people figure it out and learn their own personal style to doing things.

Instead of the traditional 1 on 1 type play, where the player controls all five players on the team, we had the idea for a 5 on 5 type of feel, with a total of 10 players online simulateneously. The 1 on 1 is a fun, and fast paced way to enjoy the game, but if the players were to each control a single player on the team, you would get a more realistic feel.

My maternal grandmother has severe dementia and should seriously be put into a proper nursing home. (She can't even remember her children's names anymore.) Obviously, I'd want her to be in a good one and make damn sure that she's treated well. However, she and my grandfather expressed to their children early on that they never wanted to be put in a nursing home, so now it has fallen to their 7 children to take care of her.

Support role is simple, if you just do what comes natural as a support player, your adc will be fed, the nearby area will be warded and any extra pressure from jungle will become irrelevant, your jungler can either get fed off of your lane so you can just chill and cs more, or he can go help other lanes. All of that creates a nice pool of income and lets you to be a bit more situational, and actually carry team, even with a defensive build.

I lent my account information to a RL friend, who used my name to create a Battle.net account. I got the account back from him, but couldn't change the name without legal proof of name change. Can't remove the authenticator without proof of ID. Is there any way to get Blizzard to help me change the name to my own name, remove the authenticator, and get access again?

And then I'm good for another few days before I'm saying hi to every pretty girl in sight...
